This repo is an exploration of my LinkedIn network.

The inital steps involved exporting a csv of my network from LinkedIn.
I wrote a script that utilized a LinkedIn scraping tool to pull the
companies' industry and size.
I added some private metrics in a hidden version of the file but uploaded a copy
with those columns removed.
I created a high level dashboard using Power BI to see the my network 
information in a more useful way.
